## Mr. Stephan's Ban List

'I feel,' 'I felt,' or 'my feelings' : As a student, you *think*, thereby producing *thoughts.*
    (Exception: A raw emotional response to something specific followed by analysis of what caused that response.)

Repetitive 'I think' : That what you are writing is your own thought is implicit.

Contractions : 'Do not' takes maybe 3 ms longer to type than 'don't,' and it saves you from looking like an idiot.

Excessive adjectives or adverbs : Rely on observations and facts rather than emotionally charged language.

Poor grammar or syntax : This is a university -- not a middle school. Plus, we have an open-access Writing Center.

'Reach' writing : The odds are low that you will impress me with your vocabulary. Write with what you know.

Personal notes rather than analysis : Nobody cares what you ate for dinner before attending the performance.

# Play Review Preview (pt. 4/4)

*a decent sentence
This play was a success because {X}, but it seems unlikely that someome
with interest {Y} would like it as a result of {Z}.

*automatic F
I feel like this play was super totally awesome, but I really don't 
think that I should recommend it to my unenlightened, dipstick roommate named Alex,
who ate a grilled cheese sandwich (being, as he/she is, a filthy turophile) 
for dinner three nights ago while binge watching The Office.
