# Final reflection: A letter to your future self

Due at 11:59 PM on Friday, December 10.

Take a minute to think back on this semester and the types of creativity you 
witnessed.

Think of what resonated most with you.

Creativity is everywhere. It takes many forms. It produces something new, but it 
borrows from the past.

That’s where you come in. You can be the bridge between problems and creative 
solutions. To do that, you need to remember and apply what you’ve learned.

Your last assignment is to *write a letter to your future self.* The letter 
should be between 650 – 750 words and turned in on Dropbox.

What did you learn this semester that you would tell yourself as advice? What 
can you use on your next journey? How do the individual and group applications 
of creative activity apply to your future?  What did you learn about yourself 
and your mode of solving problems through these activities?

Identify the foundation of your discipline and explain to your future self how 
creativity can be applied.  How does creative problem solving apply to your 
future endeavors?

This is both a final and a new beginning.

Welcome to the future.

# Mr. Stephan's Ban List

'I feel,' 'I felt,' or 'my feelings' : As a student, you *think*, thereby producing *thoughts.*
    (Exception: A raw emotional response to something specific followed by analysis of what caused that response.)

Repetitive 'I think' : That what you are writing is your own thought is implicit.

Contractions : 'Do not' takes maybe 3 ms longer to type than 'don't,' and it saves you from looking like an idiot.

Excessive adjectives or adverbs : Rely on observations and facts rather than emotionally charged language.

Poor grammar or syntax : This is a university -- not a middle school. Plus, we have an open-access Writing Center.

'Reach' writing : The odds are low that you will impress me with your vocabulary. Write with what you know.

Personal notes rather than analysis : Nobody cares that you were distracted by Facebook during lectures.

# Creative Problem Solving Exercise: Reframing Finals Stress

As a group, watch this Ted Talk: 
https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend

Problem: Finals weeks is a stressful time for students, and colleges provide a 
number of events in an attempt to reduce stress such as pet therapy, late-night 
breakfast and snacks and coffee. However, as Psychologist Kelly McGonigal points 
out in her Ted Talk, the best way to handle stress is to reframe its benefits 
and “make it your friend” rather than purely trying to mitigate the effects or 
avoid stress. With this context, how might we create events that help students 
thrive during finals week?

In this exercise, you’ll meet in groups of five to come up with creative ways to 
change the narrative around stress and increase the “courage” response during 
finals week.  Specifically, focus on concepts from this week’s reading and video 
including grit, persistence and reframing stress.

In your small groups, come up with five creative potential solutions and then 
decide as a group which solution should be implemented. Then come together and 
share your top ideas as a full group.
