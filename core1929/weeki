# Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas

Grant, O Merciful God, 
that I may ardently desire,
prudently examine, 
truthfully acknowledge,
and perfectly accomplish 
what is pleasing to Thee
for the praise and glory of Thy Name.

Problems with play papers included:

And someone even breached the "Automatic F" sentence...

I will not show mercy next time.
