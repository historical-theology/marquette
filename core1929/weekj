# Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas

Grant, O Merciful God, 
that I may ardently desire,
prudently examine, 
truthfully acknowledge,
and perfectly accomplish 
what is pleasing to Thee
for the praise and glory of Thy Name.

# Attendance

Say "present."


---

# Science Unit Debriefing (1/4)

All science unit grades are posted (as of Wednesday).

Let me know if you should have any questions.


---

# Science Unit Debriefing (2/4)

*"Generating hypotheses"* assignment submissions were lackluster:

- Dr. Blumenthal stressed that *hypotheses* are not the same as *predictions*
A *hypothesis* is *mechanistic*, *specific*, and meant to *explain a phenomenon*.
A *prediction* comes after designing an *experiment* to test a *hypothesis*.

- Many questions and hypotheses lacked due specificity
"Why do animals eat other animals?"

*"Imagine an invention"* assignment submissions were superb:

- Nearly everyone followed the directions carefully to explain a creative design

- Critiques were thoughtful and precise

- An oddly high number of students thought that it would be nice to 'understand' pets

# Science Unit Debriefing (3/4)

*Theater + Science Reflection Paper* submissions were mixed:

- Some included careful consideration of each part of the assignment page
~ 38-40/40

- Some met most of the requirements but lacked
specific class examples and/or
argument/cohesion/thesis ('glue')
~ 33-37/40

- Some were not recognizable as college essays
no paragraph divisions, lots of slang, contractions, "I feel like," etc.
< 33/40

# Science Unit Debriefing (4/4)

Takeaways from Reflection Papers

1. Most of my students seem to have thought that they were 
going to heavily favor the Biology unit but found that they liked 
at least the group assignments in the Theater unit 
the most of anything in the class so far

2. Most of my students seem to have disliked lectures in both units

2.5. Nobody wrote anything (at all) about Mr. Stephan

3. If I wrote any comments on either of your 2 papers so far,
pay attention to them while you write your 3rd and final paper (higher stakes)

4. What is 'concrete'? 
Mr. Stephan's musings on the quest for *truth*

# D2L Discussions

Most students followed the directions and wrote good *posts* AND *responses*

^ Keep doing that

# COVID-19 Creativity Task

Creative Problem Solving Exercise: Increasing Human Connection

*Problem*: Humans need connection, and the COVID-19 pandemic has created a 
mental health crisis as quarantines and disruption compound the hardships we 
are all going through. How might we help increase connection? In this 
exercise, you’ll meet in groups of five to come up with creative ways to help 
college students connect during the realities of physical distancing. 
Specifically, focus on and use your individual skills identified by Gardner’s 
Theory of Intelligences: musically, visually, verbally, logically, 
kinesthetically, interpersonally, intrapersonally, naturally, and morally.

In your small groups, *come up with five creative potential solutions and then 
decide as a group which solution would be the most effective*. Then come 
together as a full class to share each group’s solutions.

*Example*: The Counseling Center has partnered withthe online tool SilverCloud 
to offer virtual mental health resources to the Marquette community. SilverCloud 
is an online platform offering self-guided programs for anxiety, depression, 
stress and resilience. Based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles, the 
self-guided program is available anytime, on any device.
