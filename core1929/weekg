# Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas

Grant, O Merciful God, 
that I may ardently desire,
prudently examine, 
truthfully acknowledge,
and perfectly accomplish 
what is pleasing to Thee
for the praise and glory of Thy Name.

Hypothesis Assignment Discussion

1) Form a whole class circle

2) Each student: How and why did you choose the questions that you did?

Think about Dr. Blumenthal's lecture on "Choosing a Project":
- What level of biology (from ecosystem to animal to molecule) did you target? Why?
- For 'how' and 'why,' how specific have you made your questions? (And...how and why?)

3) Everyone: Feel free to interrupt, ask questions, make snide remarks, etc.
