# Prayer of St. Thomas Aquinas

Grant, O Merciful God, 
that I may ardently desire,
prudently examine, 
truthfully acknowledge,
and perfectly accomplish 
what is pleasing to Thee
for the praise and glory of Thy Name.

# Short Stories

Mr. Stephan's

A ferocious gloworm pills a ritter
with the full force of his wild gloze,
stripping all the symbols of his nobility
by burning his towering citadel 
not only to the ground
but all the way to the outermost ring of Hell,
where the lesser demons
chant their rituals of praise
for the worm-like beast
while dancing atop toxic gloxinia.
