# Bridging Polarization

*Problem*: According to Pew Research Center, evidence suggests that polarization 
has widened in the past 5 years and causes more people to get information from 
“entirely separate media bubbles.” This increasing cultural drift has far-reaching 
real-world consequences, including political-fueled violence that 
destabilizes democracy. In this environment, how might we help bridge the 
polarized divide?

In this exercise, you’ll meet in groups of five to come up with creative ways to 
decrease polarization in society. Specifically, focus on concepts from this 
week’s reading, such as methods to increase diverse environments, use 
cross-domain knowledge, or improve “bridging” social capital.

*Task*: In your small groups, come up with five creative potential solutions and then 
decide as a group which solution should be implemented. Then come together and 
share your top ideas as a full group.
