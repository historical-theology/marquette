Say "present" if so.

# What are we doing here?

Weekly discussion to follow:

1) Assigned **readings**

2) Lectures held on the preceding Tuesday and Thursday

The immediate purpose of this class is for us all to dive into and come to understand
the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien better than we do now.

To that end, **everyone must read everything assigned every week.**

# Who are you?

There are about 10 of us (depending on section). Let us go around the room. Say:

1) Your name

2) Why you are earning a Bachelor's degree at Marquette University

3) Something that matters deeply to you and **why** it so matters

# Jesuits

What type of person was St. Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus,
prior to his conversion? What sort of reflection *drove* his conversion?

Through his years of reflection, what did St. Ignatius come to see as the value of academic excellence?
Why, then, does Marquette University exist?

Let us talk about 'syntax,' that is, the order of learning that the Society of Jesus,
building on a pre-existing deep tradition from the Middle Ages, adopted for itself shortly after its founding?

1) Trivium: grammar, logic, & rhetoric (literature & history)
2) Quadrivium: math, geometry, music (physics), & astronomy
3) Philosophy (metaphysics)
4) Natural Theology (philosophy of God, ethics, & philosophy of the human person)
5) Revealed Theology (what Mr. Stephan does, because Mr. Stephan is awesome)
